This is the repository for the mediapathic site design, approximately august of
2010. It's really just here so I can work on it on multiple machines. It's probably
not very interesting unless you want to see what happens when you try to use jquery
to generate a site based on XML files.

It will eventually replace the current site at http://mediapathic.net
